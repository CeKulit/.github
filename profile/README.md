## üåü Project Overview

CeKulit is an innovative mobile application that leverages advanced AI technology to help users identify their skin type quickly and accurately. By simply taking a photo using their smartphone, users can receive instant analysis of whether their skin is oily or dry, along with personalized skincare recommendations tailored to their specific needs.

## üí° Why It Matters

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 900 million people globally are affected by various skin conditions, with limited access to dermatological care creating a significant barrier to treatment. Many individuals struggle to:
- Identify their basic skin type (oily vs. dry)
- Access professional dermatological advice
- Make informed decisions about skincare products
- Maintain proper skin health routines

CeKulit addresses these challenges by providing:
- Instant skin type analysis
- Personalized skincare recommendations
- Educational resources about skin health
- Accessible technology for everyone

## üë• Meet Our Team

Our diverse team brings together expertise in machine learning, cloud computing, and mobile development to create an innovative solution for skin health awareness.
